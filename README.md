# Investing-in-Nashville-ML-models

You just started working for a real estate company and they are looking to make a huge investment into the growing Nashville area. Theyâ€™ve acquired a dataset about recent sales and want you to build a model to help them accurately find the best value deals when they go to visit next week.  By looking at the variable, Sale Price Compared To Value, that will help us see which properties are being over/under valued. If we can build an accurate model, this could help the company identify what the key factors in finding the best deal may be.
